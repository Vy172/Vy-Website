    <p style="text-align:center">Here are some of the places I've been to!</p>

    <div class="cardSection">
        <div class="arrow centerD"><button id="backD">く</button></div>
        <div class="card" id="item1">
            <div class="cardImg"><img src="assets/disney.jpeg"></div>
            <div class="cardInfo">
                <p>Disneyland</p>
                <p>Disneyland is a must visit place if you're in California. Everything about it from the food to the scenery to the rides are all perfection. My only complaint would be the long lines and the hefty price tag (╥‸╥).</p>

            <!-- Beach -->
    <div class="card hidden" id="item2">
        <div class="cardImg">
            <img src="assets/laguna.jpg">
        </div>
    <div class="cardInfo">
        <p>Laguna Beach</p>
        <p>When I went here the water was so clear it was actually insane. The view was breathtaking and the spot I found was really quiet too. Overall a perfect place to go for a beach date with your friends or family.</p>

<!-- Fish -->
<div class="card hidden" id="item3">
    <div class="cardImg">
        <img src="assets/fish.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="cardInfo">
        <p>Aquarium</p>
        <p>Maybe it's cause I've been here so many times but this place is kinda boring.That aside, there are lots of fishes you could see here and there are even starfishes that you could touch. Also lots of attraction nearby too so you check them out too.</p>

<!-- Pasadena  -->
<div class="card hidden" id="item4">
    <div class="cardImg">
        <img src="assets/pasadena.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="cardInfo">
        <p>Pasadena</p>
        <p>Not much to say about this one, the neighborhood was really nice tho. I went trick-or-treating here for Halloween, and everyone was handing out so much candy, like full-sized bars. If you're looking for a good place to go this Halloween, I'd 100% recommend Pasadena.</p>
